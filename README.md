The Nature Of Living Beings
==========
* Living beings exist because of the forces of evolution.
* Evolution pressures living beings into a form that will likely survive and reproduce their genes in that environment.
* Evolution takes 4000 generations to make powerful adaptions for their environment.
* Powerful selection can happen much sooner than 4000 generations.
* Outside of selection, evolution shapes living beings for the environment of 4000 generations ago.

The Nature OF Modern Humans
==========
* The generation of a human has historically been around 25 years.
* Humans are evolved for the environment of 100,000 years ago (4000 human generations)
* The world has changed a lot since the dawn of civilization, 5000 years ago.
* In many ways, people have evolved for an environment which no longer exists.

Ways in which the way we were built (Evolution) does not prepare us for the world we live in (Civilized, technological world)
==========
**Donuts**
* It does not help people survive or reproduce to eat a large number of donuts every day.
* Most people have a strong desire to eat donuts that are presented in front of them.
* This desire is most likely based on evolutionary pressures, in which sources of fat were much more scarce and consuming them aggressively would assist in survival.
* The environment that human beings evolved for did not involve a plentiful supply of donuts.

**Opiates (Opium, Heroine, Prescription Opiates)**
* It does not help people survive or reproduce to become a habitual user of opiates.
* Most people have a strong desire to habitually use opiates after using them.
* The desire has to do with reward systems on the brain that are based on evolutionary pressures, where reward signalling is * used to encourage survival-benefitting and reproduction-benefitting behavior.
* Opiate addiction is a corruption of that reward system that inhibits the survival and reproductive potential of that person.
* The environment that human beings evolved for did not supply a plentiful, convienant supply of opiates.
